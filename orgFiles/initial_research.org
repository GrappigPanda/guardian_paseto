Initial Research for what needs to be done to get Paseto working with Guardian
* DONE Document all callbacks and determine their status in Paseto
CLOSED: [2018-09-12 Mi 22:39]
** build_claims/5 (module, resource, sub, claims, opts) [0/0]
*** Supported behavior
** create_token/3 (module, claims, opts) [0/0]
*** This is possible and would just need to be written.
** decode_token/3 (module, token, opts) [0/1]
*** This would be possible for public tokens, but not local.
*** TODO This would require a `peek` function
** exchange/5 (mod, old_token, from_type, to_type, opts) [0/1]
*** This functionality can immediately be done
*** TODO How are guardian keys stored/made available to modules?
** peek/2 (module, token) [0/1]
*** Only possible for public
*** TODO Write that `peek` function
** refresh/3 (module, old_token, opts) [0/0]
*** This isn't really possible given that tokens don't inherently have timers
** revoke/4 (mod, claims, token, opts) [0/0]
*** Again, revoke isn't really possible unless I want to harass a poor ets table
** token_id/0 [0/0]
*** Not really sure what this entails, can I just UUID it? It won't be consistent
** verify_claims/3 (mod, claims, opts) [0/0]
*** Default and supported behavior

build_claims/5
* TODO Implement

create_token/3
* TODO Implement

decode_token/3
* TODO Determine what exactly `decode_token/3` does
** Short, initial expectation is returns the claims?
* TODO Implement `decode_token/3`

exchange/5
* TODO Determine how guardian keys are stored [0/2]
** TODO What type are they
** TODO How are they fetched?
* TODO Implement exchange/5
  
peek/2
* TODO Determine what exactly `peek/3` does
** Short, initial expectation is returns the claims? Isn't this decode_token/3?
* TODO Implement `peek/3`
  
refresh/3
* TODO This can probably just return the same token--verify this.
  
revoke/4 
* TODO Determine what should be done here, this might not be possible?

token_id/0
* TODO Determine what exactly this should return [/]
** TODO Should it always return same thing for a given token?
* TODO Implement token_id/0

verify_claims/3
* TODO Implement
