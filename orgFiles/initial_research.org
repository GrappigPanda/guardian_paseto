** build_claims/5 (module, resource, sub, claims, opts) [0/0]
*** Supported behavior
** create_token/3 (module, claims, opts) [0/0]
*** This is possible and would just need to be written.
** decode_token/3 (module, token, opts) [0/1]
*** This would be possible for public tokens, but not local.
*** TODO This would require a `peek` function
** exchange/5 (mod, old_token, from_type, to_type, opts) [0/1]
*** This functionality can immediately be done
*** TODO How are guardian keys stored/made available to modules?
** peek/2 (module, token) [0/1]
*** Only possible for public
*** TODO Write that `peek` function
** refresh/3 (module, old_token, opts) [0/0]
*** This isn't really possible given that tokens don't inherently have timers
** revoke/4 (mod, claims, token, opts) [0/0]
*** Again, revoke isn't really possible unless I want to harass a poor ets table
** token_id/0 [0/0]
*** Not really sure what this entails, can I just UUID it? It won't be consistent
** verify_claims/3 (mod, claims, opts) [0/0]
*** Default and supported behavior

* TODO build_claims/5 [/]
** TODO Implement

* TODO create_token/3 [/]
** TODO Implement

* TODO decode_token/3 [/]
** TODO Determine what exactly `decode_token/3` does
*** Short, initial expectation is returns the claims?
** TODO Implement `decode_token/3`

* TODO exchange/5 [0/2]
** TODO Determine how guardian keys are stored [0/2]
*** TODO What type are they
*** TODO How are they fetched?
** TODO Implement exchange/5
  
* TODO peek/2 [1/2]
** DONE Determine what exactly `peek/3` does
   CLOSED: [2018-09-12 Mi 22:50]
** Short, initial expectation is returns the claims? Isn't this decode_token/3?
** NOTE: This will return the claims as a map
** TODO Implement `peek/3` [0/1]
*** TODO Grab claims map and return that _only_ on public keys
  
* TODO refresh/3 [/]
** TODO This can probably just return the same token--verify this.
  
* TODO revoke/4 [/]
** TODO Determine what should be done here, this might not be possible?

* TODO token_id/0 [/]
** TODO Determine what exactly this should return [/]
*** TODO Should it always return same thing for a given token?
** TODO Implement token_id/0

* TODO verify_claims/3 [/]
** TODO Implement
